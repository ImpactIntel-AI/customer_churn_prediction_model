# Customer Drop-Off Analysis

This project explores the reasons behind customer drop-off (churn) using Python. The goal is to identify behavioral patterns and features that influence when and why users stop engaging with a service or platform. It’s a practical example of how data science can support retention strategies, especially in both commercial and social impact settings.

## Problem Statement

High customer drop-off affects growth and sustainability. By analyzing user behavior, we aim to:
- Understand what leads to disengagement
- Predict potential drop-offs
- Suggest actionable strategies to improve retention

---

## Dataset

- **Type:** Simulated or anonymized real-world customer dataset
- **Features:** User demographics, usage history, login frequency, etc.
- **Target Variable:** Drop-off status (0 = retained, 1 = dropped off)

## Process & Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, standardized formatting  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identified key trends and correlations  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Created meaningful variables for prediction  
4. **Modeling** – Applied classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
5. **Evaluation** – Assessed model accuracy and explained key metrics  
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – Summarized findings and business implications

## Insights

- Drop-off was highest among users who had shortest subscriptions.
- Analysis shows that people with shorter tenure are more likely to churn
- Contract analysis shows that month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, while two-year contracts have the lowest churn rate.
- Internet service analysis shows that customers with fiber optic internet service have the highest churn rate, while those with DSL have a lower churn rate.
- Customers with no internet service have the lowest churn rate.
- monthly charges analysis shows that churners tend to have higher monthly charges compared to non-churners.
- Gender analysis shows that there is no significant difference in churn rates between male and female

## Key Learnings

- Data preprocessing is essential for accurate modeling.
- Visualization helps communicate complex patterns clearly.
- Machine learning can help forecast behavioral outcomes in real-world settings.
